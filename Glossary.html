    <br> 
    <br> Light Year: A light year is actually a unit of measure, the biggest known, and it is 5,879,000,000,000 or 5.879e+12 miles. Gosh that took a while to calculate.
    <br> Kardashev Scale: The Kardashev Scale is the scale that classifies living beings around the universe based on the amount of power they have.
    <br> Interstellar: Interstellar means the part of space that is outside our Solar System.
    <br> Vacuum: Vacuum isn't a typo, but actually the nothingness part of space. Aka ether Aka the black part of space Aka emptyness aka not a weird name of a thing that cleans your house for you.
    <br>Supernova: Supernova is probably the best part of space. It occurs when a star explodes and becomes either a black hole or a neutron star.
    <br>Neutron star: The result when a star 1 1/2 to 3 solar masses goes supernova and has an astonishing superpowerful magnetic field.
    <br>Solar mass: The mass of our Sun.
    <br>Black Hole: A small(space scale) thing that has an exxtremely strong gravitational pull making anything around it, even LIGHT, spaghettify. This is why light is distorted in a black hole, 
    <br>Speghettification: Yes this is a thing, and it happens when an object goes in a black hole and the black hole's gravitational force pulls so much that you stretch and your atoms just rip apart.
    <br>Event Horizon: The no-go zone in a black hole. I wouldn't recommend going past it because this is the point of no return(Spaghettification will occur).    
    <br>Astronomical Unit(AU): The distance from the Earth to the Sun. 9.296e+7 is how many miles this unit is.
