   <br><h1>Sun</h1>: The Sun is the source of most to the life on Earth because it provides heat, and energy. It has enough mass to keep pieces of rock in its orbit from trillions of kilometres away. It also takes up 99.86% of the mass of the Solar System. The average temperature is about 5.7k celsius. 
   <br><h1>Mercury</h1>: Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, just 0.4 AU away from it. It is the 2nd hottest planet, and is surprisingly cold when facing away from the Sun.
   <br><h1>Venus</h1>: The hottest planet that scientists believe was habitable, but failed to consider life. Venus is known as Earth's evil sister because it is the same size but a distopia compared to Earth because of the destructive environment. It is so heated because of Greenhouse Gases.
   <br><h1>Earth</h1>: The most dense planet is our home planet itself. Earth is in the right place aka the Goldilocks Zone so it can support life. When the Sun ages into a Red Giant, the Goldilocks zone will shift all the way to Jupiter, and Saturn.
   <br><h1>Mars</h1>: Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun, so it is one of the closest to Earth. Since it is relatively close to Earth, humans are trying to colonize this radiated planet.
   <br><h1>Asteroid Belt</h1>: The Asteroid Belt is home to many asteroids that it would be impossible to count. The biggest rock is the dwarf planet Ceres. It is 2.3 to 3.3 AU from the Sun and is between Mars and Jupiter. It is thought to be 1/1000 of the mass of the Earth.
   <br><h1>Jupiter</h1>: Jupiter is one of the planets that if weren't there, we wouldn't be able to survive. Since Jupiter is the largest planet in our Solar System, is has enogh mass to keep the asteroids from the Asteroid Belt, to hit Earth. This would make it, so if Mars wasn't there, it would be better for humans to survive. it has enough mass of all the planets in the Solar System combined x 2.5.
   <br><h1>Saturn</h1>: Saturn is most famous for its rings. Surprisingly, Saturn is less dense in water and can actually float. Saturn is 9.5 AU away from the Sun.
   <br><h1>Uranus</h1> : Uranus is unique for its tilt. It rotates the Sun on its side. It has 27 satellites.
   <br><h1>Neptune</h1>: Neptune is 30.1 AU away from the Sun and it the farthest known planet. It is slightly smaller than Uranus yet still humongous.  
   <br><h1>Kuiper Belt</h1>: The Kuiper Belt is  30 - 50 AU from the Sun. It is an asteroid belt but farther in the Solar System.
   <br><h1>Oort Cloud</h1>: Yes, I know, this is probably the funniest name anyone could make up, but it is the biggest thing in our Solar System. However, it is hypothetical.
