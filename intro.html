       First thing we need to know about the Universe, is well, what the 
    first thing that occured in the Universe was, which you all know as the Big Bang. The Big Bang Theory(not the show)
     is a theory in how the Universe was created. Scientists believe that a giant explosion,
     trillions of times more powerful than the strongest nuclear bombs we could ever make,
     exploded,  and that's what made the Universe. The theory is that the remnents of the explosion 
     made the stars and everything what not. But, getting off-topic here, scientists have discovered a star older than the
      Universe, HD 140283, otherwise known as Methuselah. Methuselah is 14 billion years old, while the Universe is 13.8 billion years old. 
      This makes HD 140283 .2 billion years older than the Universe. Methuselah is 200 million years older than the Universe!
